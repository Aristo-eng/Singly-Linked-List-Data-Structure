# Singly-Linked-List-Data-Structure
Python implementation of various functions in a linked list class. Understand about the basics of linked list and the various techniques involved in doing the desirable operation.

# what is a Linked List
Linked List is defined as a data structure wherein the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations and are linked using pointers.

## Features
- Define class Node
- Define class SingleLinkedList

## class SingleLinkedList

SingleLinkedList has methods:

- print_linked_list
```sh
def print_linked_list(self):
    # If empty linked list is given, return ""
    # else: Traversing the given LL and print values till we reach the end of the Linked list
```
- insert_at_end

```sh
def insert_at_end(self, data):
    # If empty linked list is given, head = new_node
    # else: Traversing the given LL to reach the end
```
